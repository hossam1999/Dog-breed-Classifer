# Dog-breed-Classifer
In this project, I build a Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify dogs among 133 breeds with 89% accuracy. Given an image of a dog, the algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.
